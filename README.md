# Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Visual data(such as images, video) are everywhere. Rougly, millions of visual data are generated everyday. For instance, everyday, 95 million photos and 720.000 hours of videos are uploaded on Instagram and YouTube respectively. Computer Vision equipes us with different ways to process and understand such massive datasets. Nowdays, Computer Vision is used in many real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars and drones, etc...The three most important visual recognition tasks are image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Thanks to the latest advances in deep learning techniques; softwares; and algorithms, it's now possible to build, train, and evaluate visual recognition systems on large scale datasets.

This is Deep Learning for Computer Vision Package. It is designed exactly like Complete Machine Learning Package, but it's even better. It covers foundations of computer vision and deep learning, different neural network architectures(including latest state-of-the-art stuffs), techniques, tips and tricks for training and analyzing visual recognition systems.

Deep Learning for Computer Vision Package is less about tools but more about understanding the designs of computer vision systems. Where we use a particular tool, it's merely about practice and the best tool for that. There are sections where we use TensorFlow and tools that runs on top of it, or tools that run on top of PyTorch such as Detectron2.
